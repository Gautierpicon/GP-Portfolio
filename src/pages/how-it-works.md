# This AI respects the planet and your privacy

Ecology and respect for user data are two things that are very important to me. This site will not betray my values!

## Ecology: 

The AI runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) that I host myself. Sure, it's less powerful than a real server, but it's more than enough for my needs, and it doesn't require water cooling, a ton of electricity, or anything else (and it's more fun to do everything yourself rather than just making an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) request to ChatGPT).

## Privacy:

As mentioned previously, I host the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) running the AI myself. Therefore, nothing goes through a third party. I do not keep any conversations that my users have with the AI. Once the page is deleted, everything disappears!

You don't have to take my word for it, which is why all the code is public on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Gautierpicon/Portfolio) so that anyone can verify it.
