            <h1>This AI respects the planet and your privacy</h1>
            <p>
                Ecology and respect for user data are two things that are very important to me. This site will not betray my values!
            </p>
            <h2>Ecology:</h2>
            <p>
                The AI runs on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> that I host myself. Sure, it's less powerful than a real server, but it's more than enough for my needs, and it doesn't require water cooling, a ton of electricity, or anything else (and it's more fun to do everything yourself rather than just making an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> request to ChatGPT).
            </p>
            <h2>Privacy:</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned previously, I host the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> running the AI myself. Therefore, nothing goes through a third party. I do not keep any conversations that my users have with the AI. Once the page is deleted, everything disappears!
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't have to take my word for it, which is why all the code is public on my <a href="https://github.com/Gautierpicon/Portfolio">GitHub</a> so that anyone can verify it.
